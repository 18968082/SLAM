Probabilistic_Robotics_Chapter3_Gaussian_Filters
 
Gaussian filters are a form of recursive state estimators which operate on continuous state spaces. Beliefs in this family are represented by multivariate normal distributions, equation must be found. Note that the mean vector possesses the same dimensionality as the state x. The covariance matrix is symmetric and positive-semidefinite and has a dimensionality of the state x squared. The posterior probability is represented by a Gaussian due to the Gaussian being unimodal which means that it only possesses a single maximum. Yet Gaussian posteriors are a poor match for many global estimation problems in which many distinct hypotheses exist. The mean and covariance parameters make up the moments parameterization of the distribution as they are the first and second moments of the probability distribution. An alternative to these parameters is canonical parameterization. These two parameter sets lead to the same end result but they have different computational characteristics.  
The rest of this chapter covers the Kalman Filter, which might help in the understanding of SLAM.
Later they discuss the information filter which comprises the information matrix and the infromation filter.
